  abstract      = {We study the set of infinite volume ground states of Kitaev's quantum double model on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ for an arbitrary finite abelian group $G$. It is known that these models have a unique frustration-free ground state. Here we drop the requirement of frustration freeness, and classify the full set of ground states. We show that the ground state space decomposes into $|G|^2$ different charged sectors, corresponding to the different types of abelian anyons (also known as superselection sectors). In particular, all pure ground states are equivalent to ground states that can be interpreted as describing a single excitation. Our proof proceeds by showing that each ground state can be obtained as the weak$^*$ limit of finite volume ground states of the quantum double model with suitable boundary terms. The boundary terms allow for states which represent a pair of excitations, with one excitation in the bulk and one pinned to the boundary, to be included in the ground state space.},

  abstract      = {Kitaev's quantum double model is a family of exactly solvable lattice models that realize two dimensional topological phases of matter. Originally it is based on finite groups, and is later generalized to semi-simple Hopf algebras. We rigorously define and study ribbon operators in the generalized Kitaev quantum double model. These ribbon operators are important tools to understand quasi-particle excitations. It turns out that there are some subtleties in defining the operators in contrast to what one would naively think. In particular, one has to distinguish two classes of ribbons which we call locally clockwise and locally counterclockwise ribbons. Moreover, this issue already exists in the original model based on finite non-Abelian groups. We show how certain properties would fail even in the original model if we do not distinguish these two classes of ribbons. Perhaps not surprisingly, under the new definitions ribbon operators satisfy all properties that are expected. For instance, they create quasi-particle excitations only at the end of the ribbon, and the types of the quasi-particles correspond to irreducible representations of the Drinfeld double of the input Hopf algebra. However, the proofs of these properties are much more complicated than those in the case of finite groups. This is partly due to the complications in dealing with general Hopf algebras rather than just group algebras.},
